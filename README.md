## 🏗️ How It Works

Marianne uses a sophisticated parallel downloading architecture:

1. **File Size Detection**: Performs a HEAD request to determine the total file size
2. **Chunk Planning**: Divides the file into chunks based on configured chunk size
3. **Parallel Workers**: Spawns multiple workers (default: 8) to download chunks concurrently
4. **In-Order Assembly**: Downloaded chunks are buffered and written in sequence to maintain file integrity
5. **Memory Management**: Limits buffered chunks based on available memory to prevent OOM
6. **Stream Extraction**: For TAR files, pipes data directly to `tar` command for on-the-fly extraction
7. **Temp File Extraction**: For ZIP files, downloads to temp file then extracts (enables future resume support)

### Key Components

- **Worker Pool**: Concurrent goroutines download chunks in parallel
- **Rate Limiter**: Optional bandwidth throttling using token bucket algorithm
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient network failures
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time UI updates using Bubble Tea framework
- **Chunk Coordinator**: Ensures chunks are written in correct order despite parallel downloads

## 🚀 Performance Tips

1. **Increase workers** for better speeds on fast connections:
   ```bash
   ./marianne -workers 16 URL
   ```

2. **Adjust memory limit** based on your system:
   - Systems with limited RAM: Use smaller memory limits (e.g., `-memory 500M`)
   - High-memory systems: Increase limit for better buffering (e.g., `-memory 4G`)
   - The tool automatically calculates optimal chunk sizes based on memory

3. **Adjust chunk size** based on your connection:
   - Slower connections: Use smaller chunks (1-2MB)
   - Faster connections: Use larger chunks (10MB+)
   - Default is 2MB, automatically adjusted based on memory settings

4. **Use SSD** for extraction target to avoid I/O bottlenecks

5. **Configure retries** for unreliable connections:
   ```bash
   ./marianne -max-retries 20 -retry-delay 2s URL
   ```

## ⚙️ Advanced Features

### Memory Management
Marianne automatically manages memory usage to prevent system overload:
- Default: Uses 10% of system memory for buffering
- Adjusts chunk sizes based on available memory
- Prevents excessive memory consumption on large parallel downloads
- Configure manually with `-memory` flag for fine-tuning

### Retry Logic
Robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff:
- Automatically retries failed chunk downloads (default: 10 attempts)
- Exponential backoff prevents server overload (1s to 30s delay)
- Configurable with `-max-retries` and `-retry-delay` flags
- Individual chunk retries don't affect other parallel downloads

### Chunk-Level Progress
With `-verbose` flag, monitor individual chunk progress:
- Real-time status of each downloading chunk
- Per-chunk download speeds
- Worker assignment and timing information
- Useful for debugging and performance optimization

### Security Features
Built-in security protections for safe archive extraction:
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Validates all ZIP entry paths
- **Absolute Path Blocking**: Rejects absolute paths in archives
- **Directory Escape Detection**: Ensures extracted files stay within output directory
- **Symlink Safety**: Proper handling of file permissions and modes
